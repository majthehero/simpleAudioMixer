# This is a simple audio mixing table.
I use it to play ambient sounds when DMing Dungeons and Dragon.
Actually, I haven't used it yet. I'll document the exprience when I get to use it.

Extremely minimal implementation as I only coded as much as I need.
I'll probably add functionality as I use it. If it turns out to be completely useless, I'll abandon this piece of code forever.
